## Attendance

- Mandatory for labs, **80%** minimum required.

# South Eveleigh Precinct
Used to be known as the **Australian Techonlogy Park** (ATP). *Still is, but it used to, too.*

## Directions


### Buses
[Courtesy buses][buses] are available:

- Best option is to take the bus from **Fisher Library** to **Redfern Station**, then walk to the precinct (through the new station platform as “local traffic”).
- Alternatively, direct buses are available -- but less frequent.

### Driving
Free parking is available around Henderson Road, but it is extremely crowded. We do *not* recommend driving to the precinct.

# Why study statistics?

*Why would it be relevant to my (non-statistical) career?*

## Learn, so you can...

::: {.incremental}
- Conduct effective **research**; *but if you are not a researcher*, you can still…
- Critically **evaluate** research findings; *but if you don’t plan to read scientific literature*, you can still…
- Make informed **decisions** based on evidence and know the signs when someone is trying to mislead you.

# Doing well

Attend lectures | Put in the hours | Ask questions

## Attend lectures 
### Attending a lecture is *not* the same as watching a recording...
- You can **ask questions** and *interact* with your peers.
- Your **lecturer** actively adjusts the pace/conten based on your *informal* feedback (e.g. confused looks, Google polls).
- If you don't *understand* something, there is a *good* chance that you can address it *before* the next lecture or lab.

## Put in the hours 
- This is a **6 credit point** unit, which means that you are expected to spend **120 -- 150 hours** in total, including exam prep time (~10 h per week)!
- **Practice makes perfect**. Tutorials and Labs help you apply the concepts you learn in lectures -- complete all the exercises, and practice with the bonus questions provided.

## Ask questions

- [**Ed**][edsite] is the *best* place to ask questions. We are way more responsive on **Ed** than on email.
- We are *open* to the use of AI tools (including LLMs like ChatGPT) to help you answer questions about code... but don't use them to cheat *yourself* out of learning.
- We have **drop-in sessions**, where you can jump in and have a chat on Zoom. We will announce the schedule on **Ed**.

# Learning outcomes

## By the end of this course, we want you to be able to:
- **LO1** demonstrate proficiency in designing sample schemes and analysing data from them **using R**.
- **LO2** describe and identify the basic features of an **experimental design**: replicate, treatment structure and blocking structure.
- **LO3** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to apply an ANOVA and fit regression models to experimental data.
- **LO4** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to use multivariate methods to find patterns in data.
- **LO5** interpret the output and understand conceptually how its derived of a regression, ANOVA and multivariate analysis that have been calculated by R.
- **LO6** write statistical and modelling results as part of a scientific report.
- **LO7** appraise the validity of statistical analyses used publications.


## Thanks!
