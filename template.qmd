The new Redfern Station Concourse has a local traffic gate which allows you to save about 5 minutes of walking (no OPAL card required).

### Buses
[Courtesy buses][buses] are available:

- Best option is to take the bus from **Fisher Library** to **Redfern Station**, then walk to the precinct (through the new station platform as “local traffic”).
- Alternatively, direct buses are available -- but less frequent.

### Driving
Free parking is available around Henderson Road, but it is extremely crowded. We do *not* recommend driving to the precinct.

# Why am I studying statistics?

> Doesn't seem relevant to my degree...

## Learn, so you can...

- Effectively conduct research; but if you are not a researcher, you can still…
- Critically evaluate research findings; but if you don’t plan to read scientific literature, you can still…
- Make informed decisions based on evidence and know the signs when someone is trying to mislead you.

## But, why R?

- Arguably the most popular statistical programming language in the world. Used by researchers, data scientists, and industry professionals.
- Free and open source. You can use it for your own research, or for your future job. Proprietary software (e.g. SPSS, SAS) can cost thousands of dollars per year.
- A gentle introduction to programming, which is a highly sought-after skill in the job market (even if you don’t plan to become a programmer).

# Doing well

## Attend all lectures

### Attending a lecture is not the same as watching a recording…

- You can ask questions and interact with your peers.
- Your lecturer actively adjusts the pace/conten based on your informal feedback (e.g. confused looks, Google polls).
- If you don’t understand something, there is a good chance that you can address issue before the next lecture or lab.

## Put in the hours

- This is a 6 credit point unit, which means that you are expected to spend 130 – 150 hours in total, including exam prep time (~10 h per week)!
- Practice makes perfect. Tutorials and Labs help you apply the concepts you learn in lectures – complete all the exercises, and practice with the bonus questions provided.

## Resources

- Use Ed for ALL questions related to the unit.
- You *may* ask ChatGPT if you are stuck, or need help to understand something more general.
- Drop-in sessions are available for you to get help with the unit – check Ed for the schedule.
